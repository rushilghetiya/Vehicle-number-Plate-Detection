🚗 Vehicle Number Plate Detection

A computer vision project to detect and extract vehicle number plates from images using Python and OpenCV.

🧠 Overview

This project implements a number plate detection system using image processing techniques. It uses classical computer vision methods to identify and localize vehicle number plates in real-time or static images.

🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – Image processing and contour detection
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization

✨ Features

- Detects number plates in real-world images
- Highlights and crops the number plate region
- Converts cropped plate image to grayscale for further OCR (optional extension)
- Modular and easy-to-read code structure

📁 How to Use

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rushilghetiya/Vehicle-number-Plate-Detection.git
   cd Vehicle-number-Plate-Detection
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the script
   ```bash
   python plate_detection.py
4. Add your own image. Replace the sample image in the script with your own to test detection.


🚀 Future Improvements
Integrate OCR (e.g., Tesseract) to extract alphanumeric text from plates
Add support for real-time video feed and edge detection optimizations
Deploy as a web or mobile application
